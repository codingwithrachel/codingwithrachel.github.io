            <p class="project-summary">A recent project (featured during CEO update) that I was proud to be part of was the Car Upgrades feature, where the user can upgrade to the next size up option during checkout.

              <ul>
                <li>serving as the main liason between 5+ engineering teams across the organization, including Rental Cars FE/BE, Universal Checkout, Unified Checkout Platform, and Packages</li>
                <li>creating data sequence diagrams</li>
                <li>contributing to multiple codebases with modern TypeScript/React/Node/GraphQL stack</li>
                <li>delegating engineering tasks</li>

                <li>upgrading our frontend applications to the React 18 ecosystem</li>
                <li>promoting 12 factor goals (setting up backing services for frontend applications with environment variables)</li>
                <li>solving memory leak issues</li>
                <li>updating github action workflows to enhance developer productivity</li>

            <p class="project-title">Hydrogen</p>
            <p class="project-summary">One of my favorite work projects was building out interfaces of "Hydro: Security & Identity", a two-factor authentication mobile app (DApp) that launched for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1406519814" target="_blank" class="link-color">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hydrogenplatform.hydro" target="_blank" class="link-color">Android</a> in July 2018. Read more about my experience with the team on developing the React Native app <a href="https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/developing-the-hydro-mobile-app-b0945f610e56" target="_blank" class="link-color">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">How the app works:
              <ul>
                <li>It creates a secure Ethereum wallet on your phone and saves your public Ethereum address mapped to a HydroID on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
                <li>12 seed words are also randomly generated at the time to restore your wallet in case you replace or lose your phone.</li>
                <li>Every time you authenticate with a linked website by entering a random 6-digit code that is shown on the website into the mobile app, a signed transaction is initiated on the blockchain, our immutable public ledger.</li>
                <li>Finally, the API checks if the smart contract has validated the transaction and authenticates your identity with the website.</li>
                <li>Touch ID, facial recognition, and PIN protection are also features offered by the Hydro app to provide you an extra layer of security.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="project-summary">Moreover, I developed sample apps with web3.js, such as this <a href="https://github.com/hydrogen-dev/Hydro-Auth" target="_blank" class="link-color">code</a> which performs authentication via our smart contract. A detailed walk-through of the code is available <a href="https://medium.com/hydrogen-api/authenticating-on-the-blockchain-with-hydro-web3-js-3a7de9cc906b" target="_blank" class="link-color">here</a>.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">Some of my other projects include demos and admin & analytics tools interacting with our core financial API suite. Our team used React/Redux, Angular1, Node/Express, and C3.js on the frontend.</p>
            <p class="project-summary">I also presented sales demos to potential clients and built technical prototypes at proof-of-concept workshops with other engineers.</p>

Some of the things I built with our team of engineers and designers include: marketing site, data visualizations in D3.js and C3.js, session management with Redis, and user interface for two-factor authentication.</p>
